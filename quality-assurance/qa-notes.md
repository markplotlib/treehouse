We can't test what we don't know!
That's why it's important to ask many clarifying questions and be very specific early on.

# Acceptance Criteria

Development Process:
Idea -> Feature -> Dev -> Test -> Release

QA is involved in all steps, to avoid huge design and technical challenges at launch.

The solution?  Testing as much as possible.

A system of creating acceptance criteria before anyone starts to code, is of the utmost importance.

In the planning stage, when product managers are introducing the features to the dev team.



# Testing Your Code

The QA Engineer monitors practices and create/enforce processes.


SQA (Software Quality Assurance)

manages the entire development process

SQA is not responsible for directing design and dev fixes.

Quality Control is just one piece of QA.

QA Engineering: coming up with many ways to ensure quality
designing new ways to break the software
discover problems early on in the dev process

Case Study: US Healthcare website, 2013

Key Issues:

* poorly defined requirements

* major software design issues

* not enough testing of entire website start to finish


The QA Engineer:

1. Helps define clear needs that they can test for

2. Helps design the software so that it can be tested

3. Runs all those tests


Testing: the most important aspect of SQA
