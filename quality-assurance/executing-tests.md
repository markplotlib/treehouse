# Creating a Test Plan

## 5 components 

### Scope

Objective of the Test Plan

It can also mention what tests are out of scope for the Test Plan

### Schedule

e.g., 1 hour to execute

e.g., 50% of tests should be done within one week

### Deliverables

reports and data generated from Test Plan, and possibly given to the client

* test results (which tests pass, which tests fail)

* bug report

* logs (from the product)

### Release Criteria

It gives the tester a way to be objective in the face of pressure to release a product.
Not everything in Test Plan will pass the first time around.

Release Criteria -- example:

* release must contain <primary> feature -- agreement upon the minimum features for release

* all critical defects must be fixed

* 100% of regression tests pass

Release Criteria help determine whether some components of the Test Plan are really necessary or not.

### Risks and Contingencies

Measurements of the uncertainty of testing.
Example: if customer's data is incompatible with newest release,
then a contingency can be to rollback to previous version.
